This project is the first assignment for the course Computer Vision of UU
We implemented automatic corner detection on a chessboard as well as
manual corner detection using liniar interpolation. We use this corner
detection to draw the axis and a cube on the chessboards in the right
orientation. We also implemented a feature to draw the cube in real time
using a webcam.

To run this program change to path file of variable 'images' and 'drawimages' 
to your desired path with test images. To run the live version with web-
cam change the boolean 'live' at the top to True.
