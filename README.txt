This project is the first assignment for the course Computer Vision of UU.
We implemented automatic corner detection on a chessboard as well as
manual corner detection using liniar interpolation. We use this corner
detection to draw the axis and a cube on the chessboards in the right
orientation. We also implemented a feature to draw the cube in real time
using a webcam.

To run this program change to folder path of variable 'offline' and 'online' 
to your desired path with test images. To run the live version with webcam
change the boolean 'live' at the top to True. Press 'esc' key to close webcam window.
